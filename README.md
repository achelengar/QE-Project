# QE-Project

## Getting Started

Clone the repository, and from within the project folder run the following commands to start the application locally

```powershell
npm install
```

```powershell
npm start
```

Once running, the application should be accessible at http://localhost:3000/

## Objective
In a separate folder, create a simple automation framework in your language of choice, and a couple test cases that can be run against the application locally along with a short Readme on how to install/run the tests

Here are some things we will be looking for in your solution:
- Ease of setup/install
- Tests run and pass
- Overall structure (Ideally Page-object model)
- Readability/Simplicity of code
- Use of html/css selectors
- Use of assertions

Bonus points for:
- Using Webdriver.io (or any JS based framework)
- Good code comments!
